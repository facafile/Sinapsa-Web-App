I was working on the backend of the app.
The app itself is a system for asking or reciving help for certain assigments we have for our college courses. 

When you register and login you can build your own Notice for what you want and then other people can leave a comment wanting to help you or wanting help about that topic. 
There is a gradin system implemented. One can only grade his helper if the help was offered. 
There is a ranking system for the best helpers.
You can only register if your mail domain is fer.hr but this can be chanegd easily in code.
The app is connected to a mail server and sends emails during registration, deletion of Notices and when your Notice gets a new comment.
